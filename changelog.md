## **v0.1.4** - 2021-03-19

**ADDED**

**Major**:

* NEW: Bounding Tiles implemented by @Occidio
* NEW: Display Tiles that along with Bounding Tiles can be added to *any scene*.
* NEW: Display images via copy-pasting URL feature implemented by @p4535992
* NEW: Display in Window feature alternative implemented by @DarKDinDoN
* NEW: Extra settings to accomodate the above new features -- please check the settings menu and reselect your prefered settings.

**Changes**:

**Major:**
* Special "Display Tiles" now created via button in Tile controls menu. Flagged by script, so no longer have to be very first tile in scene.
* **Warning**: Please replace regular tile in pre-made Display Scenes with new Display Tile, else the script will not detect them. 

## **v0.1.3** - 2021-01-22

**ADDED**

## **v0.1.1** - 2020-12-28

### **Added**
 **Major:**
* Added "Clear Display" button in Tiles scene control buttons. Will set 'slideshow' tile to a transparent image.

**Minor:**
* More visual effects when hovering over and clicking images in journal, for more user feedback
* Changed cursor to pointer on hover of journal images

### **Changes**

* Clicking on image in journal no longer activates the 'Display' scene if a different scene is active. Plan to add functionality later to toggle this behavior.
